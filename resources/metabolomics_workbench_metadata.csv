The study determines associations between exposures to neurotoxicants (metals and pesticides) and essential elements and non-chemical stressors in pregnant women and the impact on birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The study population consists of culturally diverse pregnant women (n=1143; ages: 16-49 years) and their babies/children (n=1069). Data collection takes place twice prenatally, at birth, 12, 36, and 48 months. Through HHEAR, targeted and untargeted (metabolomics) analyses will characterize exposure to metals in a sub-cohort of pregnant women for whom exposure data are not yet available.

Briefly, the SWHS is a population-based prospective cohort study in Shanghai, China where 74,942 women aged 40-70 years were recruited by a trained interviewer and a community health worker. The women were followed through multiple in-person interviews and self-administered questionnaires to obtain information on demographics, occupational and environmental exposures, lifestyle, dietary, and other factors, including environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and body mass index (BMI). The participation rate was 92.7%. Cohort members are followed for cancer diagnosis through in-person follow-up surveys administered every 2‚Äì3 years and annual record linkage with the Shanghai Cancer Registry and Vital Statistics Unit. All incident lung cancer cases were eligible for the current study. All study participants provided written informed consent before being interviewed, and the study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions.",Blood (plasma),,,,,,,,,,,,

Each donor gave written consent and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (EC 1430/2018). No medical substances interfering with the normal physiology of platelets such as aspirin, paracetamol or ibuprofen were taken by the donors 48 hours prior to blood donation. Two CPDA (citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine)-S-Monovette tubes (Sarstedt) of venous blood were collected per donor and donation. To isolate platelet rich plasma (PRP), the tubes were centrifuged for 20 min at 100 g with acceleration and deceleration set to 4. To purify platelets, size exclusion chromatography using 2 % B agarose beads (50-150 Œºm; abtbeads.es) was performed. Therefore, columns were equipped with a cotton frit and 20 mL of reconstituted agarose bead solution diluted 1:2 in RPMI medium (1X with L-Glutamine; Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Austria). Columns were washed with 2 mL RPMI medium before 1 ml of PRP was carefully pipetted to the column and topped with RPMI. The fraction containing purified platelets was collected and divided in two aliquots, one for platelet activation and one serving as control. To achieve platelet activation, ionomycin calcium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to one aliquot to a final concentration of 1 ŒºM. All samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature before centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min.",Blood (isolated platelets),,,,,,,,,,,,
