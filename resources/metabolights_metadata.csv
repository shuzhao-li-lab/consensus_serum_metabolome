In this paper we show a biomarker discovery approach applied to the plasma of 172 NB patients. Plasma samples from a first cohort of NB patients and age-matched healthy controls were used for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Differential expression analysis highlighted a number of metabolites annotated with a high degree of identification. Among them, 3-O-methyldopa (3-O-MD) was validated in a second cohort of NB patients using a targeted metabolite profiling approach and its prognostic potential was also analyzed by survival analysis on patients with 3 years follow-up. High expression of 3-O-MD was associated with worse prognosis in the subset of patients with stage M tumor (log-rank p < 0.05) and, among them, it was confirmed as a prognostic factor able to stratify high-risk patients older than 18 months. 3-O-MD might be thus considered as a novel prognostic biomarker of NB eligible to be included at diagnosis among catecholamine metabolite panels in prospective clinical studies.

It remains unclear how intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) impacts TOFI phenotype-related T2D risk factors associated with Asian Chinese. Cow‚Äôs milk whey protein isolate (WPI) is an insulin secretagogue which can suppress hyperglycemia in prediabetes. In this dietary intervention, we used untargeted metabolomics to characterize the postprandial WPI response in 24 overweight women with prediabetes.

An exclusion pipeline for isolating metabolites with temporal (T0-240mins) WPI responses was implemented, and a support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm was used to model relevant metabolites by ethnicity and IPFD classes. Metabolic network analysis identified glycine as a central hub in both ethnicity and IPFD WPI response networks. A depletion of glycine relative to WPI concentration was detected in Chinese and high IPFD participants independent of BMI. Urea cycle metabolites were highly represented among the ethnicity WPI metabolome model, implicating a dysregulation in ammonia and nitrogen metabolism among Chinese participants. Uric acid and purine synthesis pathways were enriched within the high IPFD cohort‚Äôs WPI metabolome response, implicating adipogenesis and insulin resistance pathways.

The multiomic dataset allowed exploration of the correlations between metabolites modulated significantly by the dietary intervention and fecal microbiota species at genus level, showing interesting interactions between Granulicatella genus and phenyl-acetic acid metabolites. Phloretin glucuronide and phloretin glucuronide sulfate appeared promising biomarkers of apple intake; however, robustness, reliability and stability data are needed for full BFI validation.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The identified apple BFIs can be used in future studies to assess compliance and to explore their health effects after apple intake.

Metabolites in pentose phosphate pathway are abundant, probably due to demand for antioxidants, NADPH, gluconeogenesis and anabolic metabolism. Global increases of TCA cycle-related compounds reflect enhanced mitochondrial activity in tissues during fasting. Enhanced purine/pyrimidine metabolites support RNA/protein synthesis and transcriptional reprogramming, which is promoted also by some fasting-related metabolites, possibly via epigenetic modulations.

UDS is a metabolome analysis that compares one sample (e.g., a patient) with control samples (a healthy population). Using liquid chromatography (LC)-HRMS full-scan analysis of human serum extracts and unsupervised data treatment, we have compared individual samples that were spiked with one xenobiotic or a higher level of one endogenous compound with control samples. After the use of different filters that drastically reduced the number of metabolites detected, the spiked compound was eventually revealed in each test sample and ranked. The proposed UDS procedure appears feasible and reliable to reveal unexpected xenobiotics (toxicology) or higher concentrations of endogenous metabolites. HRMS-based untargeted approaches could be useful as preliminary diagnostic screening when canonical processes do not reveal disease etiology nor establish a clear diagnosis and could reduce misdiagnosis.

Currently, staging relies upon detecting the very low number of parasites or elevated white blood cell numbers in CSF. Improved staging is desirable, as is the elimination of the need for lumbar puncture. Here we use metabolomics to probe samples of CSF, plasma and urine from 40 Angolan patients infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, at different disease stages. Urine samples provided no robust markers indicative of infection or stage of infection due to inherent variability in urine concentrations. Biomarkers in CSF were able to distinguish patients at stage 1 or advanced stage 2 with absolute specificity. Eleven metabolites clearly distinguished the stage in most patients and two of these (neopterin and 5-hydroxytryptophan) showed 100% specificity and sensitivity between our stage 1 and advanced stage 2 samples. Neopterin is an inflammatory biomarker previously shown in CSF of stage 2 but not stage 1 patients. 5-hydroxytryptophan is an important metabolite in the serotonin synthetic pathway, the key pathway in determining somnolence, thus offering a possible link to the eponymous symptoms of ‚Äúsleeping sickness‚Äù.

We hypothesized that different infectious agents responsible for severe febrile illness would impact on the host metabololome in different ways, and investigated the potential of plasma metabolites for diagnosis of non-malaria febrile illness. </p> Methodology: We conducted a comprehensive mass-spectrometry based metabolomics analysis of the plasma of 61 children with severe febrile illness from a malaria-endemic rural African setting. Metabolite features characteristic for non-malaria febrile illness, BSI, severe anemia and poor clinical outcome were identified by receiver operating curve analysis. </p> Principal Findings: The plasma metabolome profile of malaria and non-malaria patients revealed fundamental differences in host response, including a differential activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A simple corticosteroid signature was a good classifier of severe malaria and non-malaria febrile patients (AUC 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.93).

The first strategy is aimed at specifically analysing a limited number of known metabolites or compound classes. Alternatively, an unbiased approach can be used for profiling as many features as possible in a given metabolome without prior knowledge of the identity of these features. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry with instruments capable of measuring m/z ratios with sufficiently low mass measurement uncertainties and simultaneous high scan speeds, it is possible to combine these two strategies, allowing unbiased profiling of biological samples and targeted analysis of specific compounds at the same time without compromises.

As such exploring the metabolic changes during human breast carcinogenesis is important for developing disease prevention methods and treatments. In the present study, non-targeted metabolomics with chemometrics based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was conducted to analyze the differences in serum metabolite patterns between female patients with BC and healthy individuals. A total of 3246 metabolites at various concentrations in the sera of healthy controls and patients with BC were found. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that arginine, proline, nicotinate, nicotinamide, caffeine and arachidonic acid metabolism as well as fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly altered in BC patients in comparison to controls. These results suggest that serum metabolic profiling has great potential in discovering molecular biomarkers for the detection of BC breast cancer.

The balance between two fatty acid oxidation mechanisms, Œ≤-oxidation and œâ-oxidation, determined the extent of functional aging. Furthermore, a panel of 25 metabolites, Healthy Aging Metabolic (HAM) index, predicted healthy agers regardless of gender and race. HAM index was also validated in an independent cohort. Causal inference with machine learning implied three metabolites, b-cryptoxanthin, prolylhydroxyproline and eicosenoylcarnitine as drivers of biological aging.

Case-control studies of patients with CD have cataloged alterations in the gut microbiome composition; however, these studies fail to distinguish whether the altered gut microbiome composition is associated with initiation of CD or is the result of inflammation or drug treatment.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS:</strong> In this prospective cohort study, 3483 healthy first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with CD were recruited to identify the gut microbiome composition that precedes the onset of CD and to what extent this composition predicts the risk of developing CD. We applied a machine learning approach to the analysis of the gut microbiome composition (based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing) to define a microbial signature that associates with future development of CD. The performance of the model was assessed in an independent validation cohort.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In the validation cohort, the microbiome risk score (MRS) model yielded a hazard ratio of 2.24 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.84; P&nbsp;= .04), using the median of the MRS from the discovery cohort as the threshold. The MRS demonstrated a temporal validity by capturing individuals that developed CD up to 5 years before disease onset (area under the curve &gt; 0.65). The 5 most important taxa contributing to the MRS included Ruminococcus torques, Blautia, Colidextribacter, an uncultured genus-level group from Oscillospiraceae, and Roseburia.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> This study is the first to demonstrate that gut microbiome composition is associated with future onset of CD and suggests that gut microbiome is a contributor in the pathogenesis of CD.</h4>",['Homo sapiens'],https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/MTBLS300,['orbitrap'],"['110-1000', '80-1000', '70-1000']","['negative', 'positive']",,"['HILIC', 'reverse phase']","['ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (1.7 ¬µm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm; Waters)', 'ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide (1.7 ¬µm, 2.1 mm x 150 mm; Waters)']",,,['Xcalibur'],['Waters ACQUITY UPLC system']
